# DEBUG REPORT: MIME-Type Failures in Production

## Executive Summary

**Issue**: CSS and JavaScript assets fail to load in production with incorrect MIME-type (`text/html` instead of `text/css` or `application/javascript`), causing complete style and functionality loss.

**Key Findings**:
- The issue only occurs in production, not in development
- Root cause is the Worker's fallback behavior serving HTML for all unmatched routes
- Multiple configuration issues exist that will cause additional runtime failures
- The missing ASSETS error is a red herring; the real issue is request routing

**Critical Risks Identified**:
1. Incorrect MIME-type serving for static assets
2. Missing KV namespace configuration (SESSION)
3. Durable Objects without proper migration entries
4. Potential runtime failures for form submissions and AI features

## Symptom Log

### Development Behavior (Working Correctly)
- CSS files served with correct `Content-Type: text/css`
- JavaScript files served with correct `Content-Type: application/javascript`
- Assets loaded from `/_astro/` directory successfully
- Development server handles static assets separately from Worker

### Production Behavior (MIME-Type Failures)
- All assets served with `Content-Type: text/html`
- Browser console errors: "MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type"
- Failed requests examples:
  ```
  GET https://domain.com/_astro/index.DiwrgTda.css → text/html
  GET https://domain.com/_astro/client.BIGLHmRd.js → text/html
  ```
- Response headers show HTML content being served for CSS/JS requests

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the Issue Doesn't Occur in Development
- Wrangler dev server handles static assets separately
- Development mode bypasses the Worker's request handling for static files
- Assets are served directly by the dev server with correct MIME types

### The Worker Code That Causes the Issue
**File**: `dist/_worker.js/chunks/_@astrojs-ssr-adapter_DA4Va7tI.mjs`
**Lines**: 2028-2050

```javascript
// Simplified view of the problematic code flow:
async fetch(request, env, context) {
  // 1. Attempts to match routes
  const routeData = app.match(request);
  
  // 2. If no route matches (including /_astro/* assets)
  if (!routeData) {
    // 3. Falls through to serving the 404.html or index.html
    return new Response(htmlContent, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }
    });
  }
}
```

### How Requests Fall Through
1. Request comes in for `/_astro/index.DiwrgTda.css`
2. Worker's route matcher doesn't recognize this as a valid route
3. No asset handling logic exists in the Worker
4. Falls through to default HTML response
5. Browser receives HTML with `text/html` MIME type for a CSS file

## Configuration Issues

### 1. Asset Handling Configuration
- No explicit static asset handling in Worker code
- Missing asset manifest or routing configuration
- `_astro` directory not properly configured for serving

### 2. Missing KV Namespaces
**File**: `wrangler.toml`
```toml
# KV namespace bindings (commented out)
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "SESSION"
# id = "your-session-kv-id"
```
- SESSION KV namespace is required but commented out
- Will cause runtime errors for session management

### 3. Durable Objects Without Migrations
**Files Requiring Durable Objects**:
- `src/durable-objects/FormSessionDO.ts`
- `src/lib/durable-objects/ai-gate.ts`

**Missing Migration Entries**:
```toml
# Required but missing in wrangler.toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["FormSessionDO", "AiGateDO"]
```

## Fix Hypotheses (Ranked by Confidence)

### 1. Primary Fix for MIME-Type Issue (High Confidence)
**Hypothesis**: Add explicit asset handling to the Worker
```javascript
// In the Worker's fetch handler
if (pathname.startsWith('/_astro/')) {
  // Serve from KV or fetch from origin
  return env.ASSETS.fetch(request);
}
```

### 2. Configure Asset KV Namespace (High Confidence)
**Hypothesis**: Properly configure ASSETS namespace in wrangler.toml
```toml
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "ASSETS"
id = "your-assets-kv-id"
```

### 3. Implement Static Asset Router (Medium Confidence)
**Hypothesis**: Add middleware for static asset detection and serving
- Check file extensions (.css, .js, .png, etc.)
- Set appropriate Content-Type headers
- Serve from configured asset source

### 4. Fix KV and Durable Object Configuration (High Confidence)
**Hypothesis**: Uncomment and configure all required bindings
- Enable SESSION KV namespace
- Add migration entries for Durable Objects
- Configure AI binding properly

## Additional Runtime Risks

### 1. KV Namespace Dependencies
- Form submissions will fail without SESSION namespace
- User authentication/session management broken
- Potential data loss for in-progress forms

### 2. Durable Objects Migration Requirements
- FormSessionDO: Required for form locking and real-time collaboration
- AiGateDO: Required for AI rate limiting and quota management
- Without migrations, these features will throw runtime errors

### 3. Features That Will Fail in Production
- Form autosave functionality
- AI-powered form summaries
- Real-time form collaboration
- Session-based form progress tracking
- Rate limiting for AI features

## Next Steps for Maintainer

### 1. Validation Commands to Run
```bash
# Check current wrangler configuration
npx wrangler config

# List KV namespaces
npx wrangler kv:namespace list

# Verify Durable Objects
npx wrangler durable-objects list
```

### 2. Configuration Changes to Make

**wrangler.toml updates**:
```toml
# 1. Uncomment and configure KV namespaces
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "SESSION"
id = "create-new-or-use-existing-id"

# 2. Add ASSETS namespace if using KV for assets
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "ASSETS"
id = "create-new-assets-kv-id"

# 3. Add Durable Object migrations
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["FormSessionDO", "AiGateDO"]

# 4. Ensure AI binding is configured
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

### 3. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Create required KV namespaces: `npx wrangler kv:namespace create SESSION`
- [ ] Update wrangler.toml with namespace IDs
- [ ] Implement asset handling in Worker code
- [ ] Test asset serving locally with `npx wrangler dev`
- [ ] Deploy with migrations: `npx wrangler deploy`
- [ ] Verify MIME types in production
- [ ] Test form submissions and AI features
- [ ] Monitor error logs for runtime issues

### 4. Quick Fix Options
If immediate deployment is needed:
1. **Option A**: Use Cloudflare Pages for static assets (separate from Worker)
2. **Option B**: Implement a simple asset proxy in the Worker
3. **Option C**: Use a CDN for static assets and update asset URLs

### 5. Long-term Solution
Refactor the Worker to properly handle:
- Static asset routing with correct MIME types
- Asset caching strategies
- Proper error handling for missing assets
- Integration with Cloudflare's asset handling capabilities
